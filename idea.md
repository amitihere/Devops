# ♻️ Circular Fashion Marketplace – Print-on-Demand & Thrift Exchange Platform

A full-stack **MERN-based circular fashion marketplace** that combines **print-on-demand clothing**, **thrifted fashion resale**, and **upcycling** into a single sustainable platform.

This project goes beyond traditional e-commerce by introducing a **credit-based exchange system**, **multi-role users**, and **sustainability-driven business logic**, simulating a real-world startup-level product.

---

## 🌍 Main Idea Behind the Project

The fashion industry faces two major problems:
1. Overproduction of clothing
2. Massive textile waste from unused or discarded garments

This platform addresses both by creating a **circular fashion ecosystem** where users can:
- Design and order custom print-on-demand clothing
- Resell or exchange thrifted clothes
- Upcycle thrifted items by adding new designs
- Track sustainability impact

Instead of just *buying new clothes*, users actively participate in **reusing, redesigning, and redistributing fashion**.
